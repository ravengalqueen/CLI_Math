<h1>CLI_Math</h1>
CLI_Math is a very simple CLI calculator I made due to having issues with "expr". It only supports 2 number operations with basic arithmetics.
<h1>Usage</h1>
download the main file, put it in your home folder and run ```chmod +x calc``` then run ```sudo mv calc /usr/local/bin```
You're done! To do any operation use the following guide
calc add x y (add 2 numbers)
calc minus x y (subtract 2 numbers)
calc times x y (multiply 2 numbers)
calc divide x y (divide 2 numbers)
